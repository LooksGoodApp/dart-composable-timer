# composable_timer

Composable function timer that uses Kleisli composition

## Motivation

Pretty often functions need to be timed. Not less often, those time measurements need to have some label or description with them. 

This package provides set of helpers to do such a thing in a pure, boilerplate-free way using Monadic computation. But fear not! It is a very trivial application of such term and using this package is very straight-forward.

## Getting started

Down are listed all possible timing variations with examples.
